# Endace Relay (Cisco Hosted)

A Cisco XDR Relay implementation using [Endace](https://www.endace.com/) for full packet forensic analysis.  This implementeation
is based on the Cisco Shodan relay.

## Rationale

- We need an application that will translate API requests from SecureX Threat Response to the third-party integration, and vice versa.
- We need an application that can be completely self contained within a virtualized container using Docker.

## Testing (Optional)

Open the code folder in your terminal.
```
cd code
```

If you want to test the application you will require Docker and several dependencies from the [Pipfile](code/Pipfile) file:
```
pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pipenv && pipenv install --dev
```

You can perform two kinds of testing:

- Run static code analysis checking for any semantic discrepancies and [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliance:

  `flake8 .`

- Run the suite of unit tests and measure the code coverage:
  ```
  coverage run --source api/ -m pytest --verbose tests/unit/ && coverage report
  ```

**NOTE.** If you need input data for testing purposes you can use data from the
[observables.json](code/observables.json) file.

### Building the Docker Container
In order to build the application, we need to use a `Dockerfile`.  

 1. Open a terminal.  Build the container image using the `docker build` command.

```
docker build -t tr-05-endace .
```

 2. Once the container is built, and an image is successfully created, start your container using the `docker run` command and specify the name of the image we have just created.  By default, the container will listen for HTTP requests using port 9090.

```
docker run -dp 9090:9090 --name tr-05-endace tr-05-endace
```

 3. Watch the container logs to ensure it starts correctly.

```
docker logs tr-05-endace
```

 4. Once the container has started correctly, open your web browser to http://localhost:9090.  You should see a response from the container.

```
curl http://localhost:9090
```

## Implementation Details

This application was developed and tested under Python version 3.9.

### Implemented Relay Endpoints

- `POST /health`
  - Checks if the service is available at the moment.

- `POST /refer/observables`
  - Accepts a list of observables and filters out unsupported ones.
  - Builds an Endace Pivot-to-Vision link per each supported observable to pivot back to the
  underlying external service and look up the observable there.
  - Returns a list of those links.
  
- `POST /version`
  - Returns the current version of the application.

### Supported Types of Observables

- `ip`
